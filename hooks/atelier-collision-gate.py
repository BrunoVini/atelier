"""atelier collision gate — Stop / SubagentStop hook.

Blocks the agent from FINISHING while HTML it just generated has a real layout
collision/overflow. This is the "force" the skill prose can't provide: the
harness runs this, not the model, so a flagged collision can't be rationalized
away and shipped.

How it decides:
  • finds *.html modified in the last RECENT_SECS under the session cwd and /tmp
    (atelier scratch) — if none, this wasn't a visual task, so it no-ops;
  • renders each with atelier's responsive_check.mjs (the real sweep). Exit 1 =
    overflow/text-collision -> block. Exit 3 = no browser -> fall back to the
    static overlap_risk.py lint on the cwd;
  • a checker that merely CRASHED never blocks (we don't trust a null we can't
    explain — same discipline as review.md §3c).

Safety: a bounded retry counter (per session, in /tmp) caps consecutive blocks
at MAX_ATTEMPTS so a false positive can never hang the session — after the cap
it surfaces the finding to the user instead of looping forever. Any clean stop
resets the budget.

Output: prints {"decision":"block","reason":...} to block (Stop-hook contract);
prints {"systemMessage":...} to warn without blocking; otherwise stays silent.

Scripts location resolves to the plugin's own scripts/ (via CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT,
set by the harness when this ships as a plugin hook), and can be overridden with
ATELIER_SCRIPTS.
