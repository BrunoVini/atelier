"""atelier qa gate — Stop / SubagentStop hook.

Blocks the agent from FINISHING while HTML it just generated fails atelier's
deterministic definition of done. This is the "force" the skill prose can't
provide: the harness runs this, not the model, so a flagged failure can't be
rationalized away and shipped.

How it decides:
  • finds *.html modified SINCE THIS SESSION STARTED (and within RECENT_SECS) under
    the session cwd and /tmp (atelier scratch) — if none, this wasn't a visual task,
    so it no-ops. The session-start floor is the fix for cross-session /tmp leakage:
    a SessionStart hook stamps a per-session marker (atelier-gate-start-<hash>), and
    only HTML touched at or after that stamp is gated — so stale /tmp artifacts left
    by a PRIOR session (which predate this session's start) are never picked up;
  • runs the FULL qa gate on each (python3 scripts/qa.py <file> --hook): the
    rendered sweep (responsive reflow + chart legibility + no-JS reveal, or real
    motion for a film) PLUS the anti-slop layer. qa.py owns its own no-browser
    fallback to the static overlap lint, so this hook just maps qa's exit code:
      exit 1 -> a GENUINE FAIL verdict -> block (surfacing qa's evidence block);
      exit 0 -> clean;
      any other code (2 = qa could-not-verify: it caught an unhandled exception /
        usage error and collapsed it to a non-blocking code; 3 = no browser; or
        anything unexpected) -> do NOT block (qa already fell back internally or
        merely crashed; treat like the old exit-3 path);
  • a checker that merely CRASHED never blocks (we don't trust a null we can't
    explain — same discipline as review.md §3c): a subprocess that errors, times
    out, or returns a garbled result is surfaced as a non-blocking systemMessage.

Safety: a bounded retry counter (per session, in /tmp — overridable via
ATELIER_GATE_COUNTER_DIR) caps consecutive blocks at MAX_ATTEMPTS so a false
positive can never hang the session — after the cap
it surfaces the finding to the user instead of looping forever. Any clean stop
resets the budget.

Output: prints {"decision":"block","reason":...} to block (Stop-hook contract);
prints {"systemMessage":...} to warn without blocking; otherwise stays silent.

Scripts location resolves to the plugin's own scripts/ (via CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT,
set by the harness when this ships as a plugin hook), and can be overridden with
ATELIER_SCRIPTS.
