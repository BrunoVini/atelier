/*
 * render.mjs — make a headless render HONEST before we capture or measure it.
 *
 * A full-page screenshot (or a paint-weighted color scan) taken right after load
 * misses everything gated behind a scroll-reveal: an IntersectionObserver / CSS
 * scroll-driven animation only fires for elements that enter the viewport as the
 * user scrolls. Below-the-fold `[data-reveal]{opacity:0}` content then stays
 * invisible, so the comp a reviewer (or this skill) looks at is blank exactly where
 * the real page is full — and a layout gets scored on a half-empty image.
 *
 * driveReveals scrolls the page top→bottom to trigger those reveals, lets the
 * transitions settle, and returns to the top — so what we capture/measure is what a
 * user who scrolled the whole page would actually see. It NEVER throws: a page that
 * can't be driven is captured as-is rather than failing the capture.
 *
 * Works with a playwright OR puppeteer Page (both expose evaluate()).
