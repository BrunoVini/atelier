"""atelier qa — one entry point for the self-QA loop (the definition of done).

Five separate optional commands invite the exact rationalization the project's
own Haiku experiment documented; one verdict with a pasteable evidence block is
hard to skip or argue with. A check that crashed or found no browser is reported
`unknown` and NEVER gates — we don't trust a null we can't explain (review.md §3c).

Usage:
    python3 qa.py <artifact.html | repo-dir> [--contract <repo|tokens.json>]
                  [--widths 390,768,834,1024,1440] [--register brand|product] [--hook] [--json]

`--register` overrides the contract's own `register` field and modulates slop
severity for the active register (see slop_check.py / references/registers/).
