# Capability: Landing / marketing-page craft (make it read *designed*, not *templated*)

Anti-slop keeps a page from looking generated; **craft** is what makes it look
*designed*. Preventing tells (Inter, purple gradient, warm-neutral) only gets you to
"clean" — a clean page still loses to one with a real focal moment, motion that pays
off on scroll, and a CTA that leads the eye. Read this whenever you generate a hero,
landing, or marketing surface. Each rule below is a gate: if you can't say "yes", fix it.

This is a **brand**-register surface (the design IS the product); see `references/registers/brand.md` for the distinctiveness bar and how QA escalates the too-safe tells here.

## 1. The hero needs a focal moment with depth — not one flat pane

A single rectangular "product screenshot" pane is the template default. A designed hero
**breaks the box**:

- **Layer & overlap.** Float a secondary element partly outside/over the main pane (a
  correlated metric card, a "jump to logs" popover, a notification, a stat chip) so the
  composition has foreground/background depth, not one plane.
- **A living detail.** One small motion or state that proves the product is real — a
  blinking caret in a query line, a sparkline that draws in, a value that ticks, a
  status dot that pulses. Subtle, single, purposeful.
- **Real content, not lorem.** The hero visual should *demonstrate the pitch* (show the
  actual query→result, the before→after), not be a decorative shape.

Ask: *does the hero have a clear focal point and at least one depth layer?* If it's a
lone centered rectangle, it reads "good template" — escalate it.

**Headline ≤ ~3 lines at desktop.** A 4–5-line poster headline buries the subhead and CTA and
slows the first beat. Tighten the words or the `max-width`/measure so the hero reads in one
glance, with `text-wrap: balance` so it doesn't rag to a lone word.

## 2. Motion must pay off on scroll — load-time-only animation goes stale

Keyframes that fire once on page load (staggered `animation-delay`) are **already over**
by the time the user scrolls to the section. Below-the-fold content then arrives dead.

- Use an `IntersectionObserver` to reveal each section as it enters the viewport
  (translate-up + fade, ~400–600ms, small per-child stagger).
- **The hidden state MUST be gated on JS being present** — never `opacity:0` on the bare
  selector. Add `class="js"` to `<html>` from a synchronous inline script in `<head>`, and
  hide only `.js [data-reveal]`. So no-JS users, crawlers, print, AND every static
  screenshot see the *content*, not a blank pane; JS only enhances. Also gate inside
  `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` so reduced-motion users get the final state.

```html
<head><script>document.documentElement.classList.add('js')</script></head>
```
```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('[data-reveal]');
const reveal = (el) => el.classList.add('in');
if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
  const io = new IntersectionObserver((es) => es.forEach(e => {
    if (e.isIntersecting) { reveal(e.target); io.unobserve(e.target); }
  }), { threshold: 0.15 });
  els.forEach(el => io.observe(el));
  // SAFETY NET — if the observer never fires for an element (off-screen math, a tall section that
  // never crosses the threshold, a wiring slip), reveal everything still hidden shortly after load.
  // Without this, a section can sit at opacity:0 *with JS on* and ship blank to real users.
  addEventListener('load', () => setTimeout(() => els.forEach(el => { if (!el.classList.contains('in')) reveal(el); }), 1500));
} else {
  els.forEach(reveal);   // IO unsupported → show everything immediately
}
```
```css
/* visible by DEFAULT; only hide-then-reveal when JS is present AND motion is allowed */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion:no-preference){
  .js [data-reveal]{opacity:0;transform:translateY(16px);transition:opacity .5s,transform .5s}
}
[data-reveal].in{opacity:1;transform:none}
```

The fragile version — `[data-reveal]{opacity:0}` on the bare selector, flipped by JS — is
the **single most common reason a generated page screenshots blank below the fold** (the
reveal never fires without a scroll event; no-JS/crawlers/print get nothing). `qa.py` now
runs `reveal_check.mjs`, which renders the page with its scripts stripped and **fails as
`important` if a large share of text is invisible without JS** — so the robust pattern
above is the definition of done, not a nicety.

Ask: *does each below-the-fold section animate in on scroll, AND still show its content
with JS disabled (reveal_check clean)?*

## 3. Vary section treatments — kill template filler

The "3 identical centered cards" row and the generic "2×N number tiles" block are the
two most template-like blocks on any landing page.

- **Show the product more than once, differently.** If the hero is a console, the
  how-it-works should be a *different* surface (a config snippet with a copy button, a
  tabbed correlated view, an alert→trace pivot) — not the same pane again, and not a
  flat stat grid standing in for a second product moment.
- **Differentiate repeated elements.** If you must use cards, vary alignment, add a
  hover-revealed detail, asymmetric sizing, or a real artifact inside — don't ship three
  clones.
- **Earn every block.** A stat strip is fine *as accent*, not as the substitute for a
  second real product surface.
- **No dead space inside equal-height cards.** When a grid equalizes row heights, a sparse
  card becomes a slab of emptiness next to a dense sibling. Either let cards size to their
  content (`align-items: start`), give the thin card a real artifact, or rebalance what's in
  each — never ship a card that's mostly padding. (Same for a tall feature card with a short
  body: fill it or shrink it.)
- **Kill orphans everywhere, not just in headings.** Apply `text-wrap: pretty` (or `balance`)
  to sub-heads, ledes, and card copy too — a lone-word last line ("…card.") reads as unfinished.

Ask: *is any block pure filler (identical clones, a number grid with nothing to show)?*

## 4. The primary CTA must be the loudest pixel — at rest, not only on hover

A conversion page has ONE action that should win the eye before any interaction. A flat
CTA that only lifts on hover under-sells itself.

- Give the resting primary CTA real presence: full accent fill, weight, and a directional
  affordance (an `→`). The secondary CTA stays quiet (ghost/outline).
- It should still read as the focal action in a grayscale screenshot.
- **Presence comes from weight/fill/contrast, not a neon glow.** A literal box-shadow "glow"
  plus pulsing status dots is the dark-SaaS genre default a discerning reviewer marks as a
  tell — earn presence through size, fill, and surrounding restraint instead, unless the
  page's concept genuinely calls for emission (e.g. an actual instrument readout).

Ask: *if I squint, is the primary CTA obviously the brightest/heaviest element?*

## 5. Keyboard focus is mandatory (it's also a free win)

AI routinely styles `:hover` and forgets `:focus`. A real designer ships a visible focus
ring. `slop_check.py` now flags `no-focus-visible` as **important** — so this is part of
the definition of done, not optional.

```css
.btn:focus-visible, a:focus-visible, button:focus-visible,
:where(input,select,textarea):focus-visible{
  outline:2px solid var(--primary); outline-offset:2px;
}
```

## 6. Finish interactions honestly — half-wired is worse than omitted

A marquee interaction that's broken or faked undercuts the whole page on close read:

- **A control that exists must work and work correctly.** A "Copy" button must copy the
  real payload (strip comment lines / fix whitespace), not `innerText` verbatim. If you
  won't wire it, don't ship it as an actionable control.
- **Click and keyboard must not diverge.** If a search box reveals/focuses its input on
  `⌘K`, clicking the same affordance must do it too — don't leave the real input parked at
  `left:-9999px` for mouse users. Every affordance works by both pointer and keyboard.
- **Don't `aria-hidden` real content.** A marquee/ticker of services, a row of client
  names, or a stat strip carries information — hiding it from assistive tech to "reduce
  noise" deletes content for screen-reader users. Reserve `aria-hidden` for purely
  decorative glyphs/shapes; if a moving strip is real content, let it read (once) or mirror
  it in a visually-hidden list.
- **Don't half-implement ARIA.** A `role="tablist"` needs real keyboard operation
  (arrow-key roving `tabindex`); a `role="img"` on a structured/interactive region hides
  all its content from assistive tech. Partial ARIA can be worse than none — match the
  role to the actual behavior.
- **Don't fake the wiring.** Footer/nav links should point at real (or honestly distinct)
  targets — not all resolve to `#hero`. Clicking "Careers" landing on a testimonial reads
  as filler. And don't game it the other way: pointing eight distinct links all at one
  real-looking anchor (`#start`) is still dishonest. Route honestly, or mark non-functional
  demo links `aria-disabled="true"` / `href="#"` and say so. A **primary CTA must not
  self-anchor to its own containing section** (`<section id="start">…<a href="#start">`) —
  clicking scrolls to where you already are, an inert action that reads as broken on click.
- **The settled state is full-opacity, and the skip link must un-clip on focus.** Entrance/
  reveal animations must END at `opacity:1` (never leave a section faded in the resting state —
  it reads "washed-out" in any capture or for a user who lands mid-fade). The visually-hidden
  skip link must become fully visible and in-flow on `:focus` (a common bug is a clipped
  `sr-only` skip link whose `:focus` rule never restores it).
- **Never `display:none` real content at mobile — reflow it.** Hiding the 2nd/3rd columns
  of a board, or the hero's signature visual, on phones deletes substance the page promised.
  Stack, horizontally scroll, or condense instead, so small screens get the whole story.
- **SVG that connects to layout must not drift.** A node-graph / connector SVG with
  `preserveAspectRatio="none"` + hardcoded bezier endpoints lines up only at the design
  width and smears strokes elsewhere. Draw connectors from measured positions, anchor nodes
  absolutely in the SVG's own coordinate space, or use `vector-effect:non-scaling-stroke`
  with a fixed aspect — so the diagram holds at every width.
- **Swappable panels (tabs) of different heights jump the page.** Lock a consistent panel
  height or animate the transition so switching a build/deploy/monitor tab doesn't shift
  everything below it.
- **Tie in-view micro-motion to the reveal, not load.** Data-viz inside a below-the-fold
  section (bars growing, sparkline drawing) should animate when that section reveals —
  otherwise it finishes before the user scrolls to it and arrives dead. Trigger it from
  the same IntersectionObserver as the section.
- **A chart's real values are its DEFAULT state, not a JS payload.** Bar heights/widths,
  **meter / progress fills**, gauge angles, and sparkline paths must be set in the CSS/markup
  at their true value (e.g. `style="--h:72%"` consumed by CSS, or the `<rect height>`/`<path d>` drawn), so
  the chart shows its data with JavaScript disabled, in print, and if the reveal never fires.
  JS may animate *from* a start state (`@media (prefers-reduced-motion:no-preference){.js …}`),
  but a bar that is empty/zero until a script fills it renders as a blank chart for no-JS users
  and in every static capture — the same failure as the reveal gate, and reveal_check can't see
  an empty bar the way it sees missing text. Same rule as animated numbers: the settled value
  is the source of truth.
  **Watch the reveal-class trap:** if you write `.js .chart.in .bar{transform:scaleY(1)}` but the
  IntersectionObserver only adds `.in` to the *card* (`[data-reveal]`), not `.chart`, the bars
  default to `scaleY(0)` and **never reveal with JS on** — a blank centerpiece chart that
  ironically renders *only* with JS off. Put the true value on the resting selector and let the
  reveal be a no-op-safe enhancement; then EYEBALL the JS-on screenshot (after scrolling) and
  confirm every bar/mark is actually filled — a passing qa.py does not prove the chart drew.
- **Animated numbers: the final value is the accessible value.** A count-up must have the
  real final number as its initial DOM text (animate the *display* from 0 visually), or be
  `aria-hidden` with a visually-hidden real value beside it. Never leave a literal `0`/`$0`
  as the accessible name — it FOUCs to "0" if JS is slow/blocked and never announces the
  settled figure.
- **Don't collapse a live data panel into one brittle `role="img"`.** A dashboard/console
  with real numbers shouldn't be a single `role="img"` whose hardcoded `aria-label`
  silently desyncs when the copy changes. Expose the key figures as real text; reserve
  `aria-hidden` for the purely decorative chart paths.
- **No browser-only properties on focal content.** Avoid WebKit-only tricks like
  `-webkit-text-security` for a hero card's masked digits (renders as literal `X`s in
  Firefox). Use a cross-browser technique (bullet glyphs `•`, SVG, or real masked text).
- **Use the right ARIA for the widget.** A mutually-exclusive segmented control
  (monthly/annual, tabs-as-choice) is a `role="radiogroup"`+`role="radio"`/`aria-checked`
  or a single `role="switch"` — NOT two independent `aria-pressed` buttons (that announces
  them as unrelated toggles, hiding the either/or). Match the role to the real behavior.
- **Animate numbers from the canonical value and cancel in-flight tweens.** A count-up must
  read its start/target from the data attribute, not `el.textContent` (which is mid-tween on
  rapid re-trigger), and must store + clear its timer per element before starting a new one —
  otherwise fast toggling races overlapping intervals onto a stale number.

## 7. Match the focal moment to the genre — restraint is editing, not thinness

The hero's focal element depends on what's being sold, and "restrained" never means "sparse".

- **Reserve the accent color — spreading it is the most common restraint leak.** Having ONE
  accent hue is not enough; *where you spend it* is what reads as restraint. The strongest, most
  institutional move is to reserve the accent for the single most important thing — the primary
  CTA, and at most the one hero figure it's selling (the APY, the price) — and carry everything
  else in tinted neutrals (ink, paper, hairlines). When the same accent also tints the
  checkmarks, the section eyebrows, the icons, a stats band, the footer links, *and* the CTA, the
  page reads busier and — worse — the CTA loses its pull, because the eye no longer has one place
  the color sends it. A reviewer comparing two otherwise-equal pages will score the one that
  spends its accent on one or two deliberate places as more restrained and more confident than the
  one that sprinkles it everywhere. Spend color like money: on the decision you want the visitor
  to make. (Trust/finance especially: a single reserved accent on the rate + the CTA out-reads a
  page where the brand hue is everywhere.)
- **The hero value-prop headline must COMMAND the fold — a refined face still has to earn
  primacy through scale.** The headline is the single most dominant element above the fold; the
  eye must land on it first, before any hero card/figure, CTA, or trust strip. A characterful
  serif or a quiet palette is not an excuse for a timid headline — elegance and dominance are not
  in tension. If a hero figure-card (a price, an APY, a product shot) competes with or out-shouts
  the headline, the value prop loses primacy and the page reads less confident, even though the
  card is "prettier." Earn dominance with real scale, a tight rag, and deference from everything
  around it (the card sits clearly secondary). A heavy sans wins "hierarchy" by brute size; a
  serif wins it by being set large and surrounded by enough air that nothing else competes — match
  that command, don't cede it.
- **Finish: don't let the hero headline crowd the hero card/figure.** When the hero pairs a
  headline column with a figure/product card, leave a real gutter between them — at the primary
  desktop width the last words of the headline rag must not run up against (or visually collide
  with) the card edge. Check the rendered 1440 frame: if the rag and the card are kissing, widen
  the gutter, shorten the measure, or rebalance the columns. A cramped hero is the first thing a
  finish-focused reviewer docks even when everything else is clean.
- **Trust/reassurance signals are a feature, not fine print — set them at CONFIDENT contrast.** A
  security/insurance/compliance strip (FDIC-insured, encryption, SOC 2) is load-bearing on a
  finance or security page; setting it small and in low-contrast grey undercuts the very
  reassurance it exists to give (and reads as unfinished even when it technically passes AA). Give
  trust cues legible size and near-body contrast, and make their icons crisp. Reserve the faint,
  low-contrast treatment for genuinely incidental fine print (legal disclaimers), not for the
  signals you want the visitor to believe.
- **Spatial restraint: a dense page must BREATHE, or a sparse one out-restraints it.** Reserving
  the accent and collapsing the palette is *chromatic* restraint; it is only half the job. A
  data-dense page (an observability/analytics/devtool landing with charts, diagrams, code) competes
  on "restraint" against sparser pages that win it almost for free through generous whitespace — so
  density must be paid for with AIR. Give each dense panel real margin and internal padding; put ONE
  clear focus per band (don't stack a chart + a readout + a sparkline + a diagram into one crowded
  hero); widen section gutters; let the page have quiet zones between the instrument-heavy ones.
  The goal is "calm instrument," not "cockpit at full alert": a reviewer should read the density as
  *confident and organized*, never as *busy*. If a section has three competing focal elements,
  demote two. Density earns industry-fit and finish; breathing room is what keeps it from costing
  restraint — you can hold all three at once.
- **Finish is a LEVEL above "clean" — earn the win, don't just avoid errors.** Two pages can both
  be error-free (consistent spacing, aligned, no banding) and a sharp reviewer will still rank one
  higher on finish. The gap is *considered detail* the merely-clean page lacks: surface depth on
  dark cards/bands (a whisper of gradient, an inner top hairline catching light, a 1px edge — a
  flat dark block reads less finished than a modelled surface), optical corrections (true optical
  centering, hung punctuation/bullets, figure baselines aligned), crisp custom iconography on a
  shared grid, and visible interaction states (hover/active/focus that feel built, not default).
  Pick two or three such moves and execute them precisely — that is what turns an 8 into a 9 when
  you're already clean. "No mistakes" ties; a considered detail wins.
- **When the product IS the hero (e-commerce, hardware, a watch/device), the product render
  is the focal moment — invest in detail.** A hero watch needs a dense minute track, real
  indices, subdials, a date aperture — gravitas. A near-empty dial reads cheap, not minimal.
  A clean dev console still needs real rows and a live value. Don't ship a thin centerpiece
  and call it restraint; restraint is *removing clutter around* a richly-made focal object.
- **Premium reads as QUIET — for a luxury/premium product hero, less around the product is MORE.**
  The single most common way to make an expensive product look cheap is to surround it with stuff:
  a second showcase band, a stat strip, a spec table, feature glyphs, and the accent color sprayed
  across the price AND both CTAs AND the eyebrows AND the section bands. Density and a loud accent
  read as *mass-market/conversion-grind*, not *premium*. The quiet page — one beautiful product
  render with room to breathe, the accent reserved to the SINGLE primary action (Add to cart),
  generous whitespace, a characterful editorial display voice, and only the few sections the brief
  asks for — out-premiums the feature-packed one every time. A blind reviewer scores the hushed
  page higher on both restraint AND "does this feel expensive." So: invest everything in the
  product render and the type; then *remove*, don't add. If you've built two dark bands and three
  data widgets around a $329 object, you've made it look like a $79 one. (This is the luxury-
  register sharpening of "reserve the accent" and "a dense page must breathe": here restraint is
  not a tax on the register — it IS the register.)
- **The hero artifact must match what's purchasable.** Showing a hero product (color/case/
  finish) that matches none of the items in the collection below is a credibility-killer —
  a real maison shows a flagship you can actually buy. Keep hero and catalog consistent.
- **Product specs must be internally consistent.** Don't say "automatic" on the dial and
  "hand-wound" in a spec chip, or quote one capacity in two places. Contradictory product
  facts read as a copy-paste artifact and break trust on exactly the page meant to build it.
- **Pick the characterful face for the genre, not the safe one.** Luxury/editorial wants the
  most characterful appropriate display cut (Cormorant Garamond, Fraunces, Newsreader) paired
  with an editorial body, hierarchy carried by scale + whitespace, not weight. A plain
  humanist body under a serif is a half-step below — commit to the pairing the genre rewards.
- **Copy matches the register.** Luxury/editorial copy is *evocative*, not merely clear;
  developer copy is terse and concrete; fintech is precise and trustworthy. Write to the
  genre's voice, not a generic "benefit + adjective" line.
- **No dead markup or dead controls.** Remove abandoned/empty element groups (a commented
  "generated ticks" block with nothing in it), and never ship a control that does nothing
  (a "Menu" button with no handler). It reads as unfinished on close inspection.

## 8. Type engineering floor — the craft that separates *designed* from *default*

A characterful pairing chosen well is only half the type work. The detail that reads as
"a designer set this" is mechanical, and AI usually skips it. Ship all of it:

- **Fluid type scale, not fixed px.** Size the display and headings with `clamp()` off one
  modular ratio (≈1.25–1.333), so the hierarchy holds from 390px to 1440px without a wall of
  breakpoints. `h1: clamp(2.5rem, 6vw + 1rem, 4.5rem)`; step body/labels off the same ratio.
- **Tabular numerals on all data.** Any aligned/changing figure — metrics, prices, counts,
  SHAs, timestamps, table cells — gets `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` (and `slashed-zero`
  for code/IDs). Proportional digits in a stat row jitter and misalign; it's an instant tell.
- **Govern line length and wrapping.** Body copy capped at a `max-width` of ~60–75ch
  (`measure`); headings get `text-wrap: balance`, long paragraphs `text-wrap: pretty` to kill
  orphans/rivers. Set `line-height` looser for body (~1.5–1.6), tighter for display (~1.05–1.15).
- **Metric-matched fallback so the page doesn't reflow when the web font lands.** Declare a
  fallback `@font-face` over a system face with `size-adjust` / `ascent-override` /
  `descent-override` / `line-gap-override` tuned to the real font, and reference it in the
  stack (`"Brand", "Brand Fallback", system-ui`). The page then renders on-metric offline and
  during font swap — no CLS, no jarring jump. (This is also why the offline screenshot looks
  finished, not bare.)
- **The BODY must stay characterful offline too — not just the display face.** The single
  cheapest tell is a hero in a real face over body copy that has collapsed to bare
  `Arial`/`Helvetica`/`Times`. Give the body the SAME metric-matched fallback treatment, or
  end its stack in a distinctive system set (`ui-sans-serif, system-ui, …`) — never let
  `…, Arial, sans-serif` be the effective render. Always judge the **offline** screenshot
  (webfont not loaded), because that's what a reviewer on a cold cache sees.
- **Optical detail.** `letter-spacing` tightens slightly as display size grows (negative em on
  large headings); set `font-feature-settings`/`font-variant` for the face's real features
  (oldstyle figures for editorial, `ss01` etc. where the family offers them). Hang punctuation
  / use `text-wrap: balance` rather than manual `<br>`.

Ask: *fluid scale off one ratio · tabular-nums on every figure · measure capped + balanced
headings · metric-matched fallback so nothing reflows?* If any is "no", it reads as default.

See `../design-laws.md` for the quantified thresholds (hero ceiling, tracking floor,
line-height, measure, font count) and which the QA battery enforces.

## 9. Honest proof — never fabricate social proof

A greenfield or fictional product has no customers yet. Inventing a customer **logo wall**,
**named testimonials** ("— Jane Smith, VP Eng at Northwind"), or precise **marketing-multiplier
stats** ("94% fewer incidents", "6.2× faster") is the single most recognizable AI-SaaS-slop
move — a careful reviewer spots it instantly and it torches credibility on exactly the section
meant to build it. `slop_check.py` now flags a logo-wall + testimonials combo, and a page of
mostly dead `aria-disabled` links, as `important`.

Use proof you can actually stand behind:
- **Honest, checkable signals** instead of fake logos: the SDKs / languages / frameworks it
  integrates with, standards it implements, "open source / MIT", a real changelog, docs depth.
- **Show the product working** rather than quoting fictional people: a real query→result, a
  before→after, an actual config, sample data clearly framed as an example.
- If the genre truly needs a voice, use a **single clearly-attributed, plausible quote** or a
  "why we built this" note — not a grid of manufactured endorsements.
- Numbers must be **defensible or explicitly illustrative** — don't assert invented percentages
  as fact. And **wire the primary CTA and nav**; reserve `aria-disabled` for a few clearly-demo
  affordances, not the whole page (a landing whose actions don't work reads as unfinished).
- **No scale-theater.** A throughput/volume flex ("1.4M events/min", "trusted with billions of
  spans", "powering 10,000 teams") implies traction a brand-new product hasn't earned and
  *contradicts* an honest "we're early" voice — a senior reader reads it as fiction. If you cite
  a figure, make it a **product fact you can stand behind** (a latency target, a retention window,
  "self-host", "MIT", a real benchmark), not implied customer scale.

Ask: *would this proof survive someone asking "is that real?"* If not, cut it or make it honest.

**Show honesty; don't announce it.** State verifiable facts plainly and let them speak. If you use
an explicit "we're early / no logo wall yet" device, use it **once** — repeating anti-slop
meta-commentary ("not vibes", "not another adjective-driven feature list", "no logos we can't
earn") is itself a pose that reads as protesting too much, and a discerning reader marks it down.
A plain, literal, confident headline often out-restrains a clever one.

## 10. Subvert the genre default — the expected look loses to a committed one

Every genre has a default skin the model reaches for first: dark terminal/console for dev-tools,
indigo gradient for SaaS, warm-paper for editorial, teal-and-rounded for health. Shipping the
default reads as "good template"; a blind reviewer rewards the entry that commits to a fresher,
still-appropriate aesthetic. Name the cliché for *this* brief, then choose an owned direction that
still fits the audience — it can be light or dark (just not the flagged warm-paper monoculture or
the genre default), carried by one decisive concept (a printed-instrument readout, a blueprint, a
ledger, a measurement grid…) rather than the first look anyone would reach for. Restraint and
credibility don't require the default; they require commitment. (Pairs with the cold-start
anti-sameness ledger — `cold_start_ledger.py` — so successive briefs don't converge.)

Ask: *is this the first look anyone would reach for, or one I chose on purpose?*

## Reach-for: the moves that read *designed*

The gates above are mostly "avoid". Avoidance gets you to clean; it does not tell you what
to reach FOR. This is the positive palette: named alternatives to the defaults, so you can
replace a reflex with a specific decision instead of just deleting it. Every genre's reflex
fonts, styles, and hues live in `../knowledge/reflex-reject.csv`; its `reach_for` column names
the concrete distinctive alternative for that exact genre. Read your genre's row before you
choose, then commit to the move.

**Type pairing — reach for a face with a point of view.** The defaults (Inter, Space Grotesk,
Plus Jakarta, Geist, Fraunces) are competent and invisible. Pair a characterful display cut
with a workhorse body that has its own texture: Söhne or ABC Diatype as a body that still
reads owned; Reckless, GT Sectra, Canela, Lyon, Tiempos, or Editorial New as a display voice;
Berkeley Mono or IBM Plex Mono reserved strictly for code and figures. Pick the cut the genre
rewards (a luxury maison earns a high-contrast display; a dev tool earns a precise grotesk),
set the hierarchy with scale and whitespace, and give every figure `tabular-nums`.

**Focal-moment composition — reach for one deliberate break in the grid.** Instead of the
centered hero pane, choose a single composition move and commit: a real artifact floated over
the fold with a depth layer behind it; an asymmetric split where the product's actual state
(a query→result, a before→after, a live value) carries the left and the claim carries the
right; one living detail that proves the thing runs. The focal moment demonstrates the pitch;
it is not decoration around it.

**Color commitment — reach for the product's own material, not the genre hue.** The genre
default hue (SaaS indigo, fintech emerald, health sky-blue, dev violet) is the tell. Source
the palette from the product's literal job: a reconciliation tool's settle-green, a coffee
box's roast browns, a track's red, the actual material of a luxury good, the customer's own
industry color. The `reach_for` column states this per genre. One owned ground plus one
sourced accent beats any default duo.

**Copy voice — name the specific outcome.** The first-order clichés (the "unlock-the-power /
next-level" register) are caught by `slop_check.py`'s `marketing-cliche`; the quieter second-order
"safe" marketing voice is caught by `marketing-microtell` (the same check flags "X,
reimagined", "that just works", "10x your <noun>", "the modern way to", "X, simplified", and
their kin). Both are polish-severity prompts to rewrite. The fix is always the same: say the
literal, checkable thing the product does. Before → after:

- "Run your books on autopilot." → "Close the books in one pass: every transaction matched to
  its receipt before you export."
- "The modern way to invoice." → "Send an invoice, get paid by card or ACH, and see it
  reconcile against the bank line the same day."
- "Accounting, simplified." → "One ledger for receipts, invoices, and payroll — no
  spreadsheet exports, no copy-paste between four tools."

Each rewrite names the outcome a skeptic could check, which is exactly what the micro-tell
was papering over. The reflex copy is interchangeable across products; the specific outcome
could only describe this one.

Ask: *for type, composition, color, and copy, did I name a specific decision — or did I just
remove the default and leave the slot empty?*

## Definition of done for a landing surface

Before you call a hero/landing page finished, all of these are "yes":

- [ ] Hero has a focal point **and** a depth/overlap layer (not one flat pane)
- [ ] One purposeful living detail in the hero (caret/sparkline/tick/pulse)
- [ ] Below-the-fold sections reveal on scroll, gated by reduced-motion
- [ ] **Content visible without JS** — reveals gated on `html.js`, `reveal_check.mjs` clean
- [ ] Type floor: fluid `clamp()` scale · `tabular-nums` on data · `measure` cap + balanced
      headings · metric-matched fallback `@font-face` (no reflow on font swap)
- [ ] **Honest proof** — no fabricated logo wall / named testimonials / invented stats;
      primary CTA + nav are wired (not a page of `aria-disabled` dead links)
- [ ] **Owned aesthetic, not the genre default** (subverts the first-reach cliché)
- [ ] **Reach-for, not just avoid** — type, composition, color, and copy each name a specific
      decision (see this genre's `reach_for` in `../knowledge/reflex-reject.csv`); copy is clean
      of `marketing-microtell`, every claim naming a checkable outcome
- [ ] No template filler (no 3 clone cards, no number-grid standing in for product)
- [ ] Product shown more than once, with **different** surfaces
- [ ] Primary CTA is the loudest pixel at rest (glow/fill/arrow); secondary is quiet
- [ ] `:focus-visible` ring on every interactive control
- [ ] Every shipped control actually works; ARIA matches behavior; links target real anchors
- [ ] In-view micro-animations trigger on section reveal, not at page load
- [ ] `slop_check.py` clean of `important` (incl. `no-focus-visible`); contrast AA

This is the craft layer on top of anti-slop. Clean + crafted is how the page wins.
