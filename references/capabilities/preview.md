# Capability: Live Preview (local port)

Open a local web server the user can view in their browser, serving design output
with click-to-select interaction. This is atelier's native version of the
superpowers visual-companion, fed with huashu-quality HTML themed by the repo's
`DESIGN.md` tokens — so you no longer need two skills to do it.

**When to open a preview:**
- The user asks to **see / show / demo** something ("show me", "let's see it",
  "open a preview", "mostra", "demonstração").
- The user wants **suggestions or a direction** and choosing is easier by looking
  (→ pair with `variants.md`).
- You're iterating on look-and-feel where words are slower than a glance.

**Scale the sample to the context:**
- **Clear direction** (DESIGN.md exists, single ask) → serve **one** themed,
  hi-fi sample.
- **User is choosing** (vague brief, "give me options") → serve **2–4 variants
  side by side** (split/cards) so they can click to pick.

## Start the server

The server watches a directory and serves the **newest** HTML file in it.

```bash
scripts/preview/start.sh --project-dir /path/to/repo
# -> {"type":"server-started","port":52341,"url":"http://localhost:52341",
#     "screen_dir":".../content","state_dir":".../state"}
```

- Run it with the Bash tool's **`run_in_background: true`** so it survives across
  turns. If you didn't capture stdout, read `$STATE_DIR/server-info` for the URL.
- Pass `--project-dir <repo>` so previews persist under
  `.atelier-preview/` (remind the user to gitignore it). Without it, files go to
  `/tmp`.
- Remote/containerized host unreachable? bind non-loopback:
  `--host 0.0.0.0 --url-host localhost`.
- The server auto-exits after 30 min idle. Before each write, check
  `$STATE_DIR/server-info` exists (and no `server-stopped`); restart if needed.
- **Fallback (sandboxed hosts):** some environments reap the detached node
  process even when `start.sh` returns 0 (the port becomes unreachable). If the
  URL doesn't respond, don't block — the server serves your newest file verbatim,
  so validate the artifact directly on disk (open the `screen_dir` file / run a
  `screenshot.mjs` capture) and tell the user the file path alongside the URL.

## Two kinds of screens

### A) Option / selection screens → write a content **fragment**
The server wraps fragments in its frame (theme CSS, selection bar, click
handlers). Use for "pick a direction / layout / palette" questions.

```html
<h2>Which direction for the dashboard?</h2>
<p class="subtitle">Click to choose — we'll build the winner out fully.</p>
<div class="cards">
  <div class="card" data-choice="editorial" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="card-image"><!-- mini mockup --></div>
    <div class="card-body"><h3>Editorial</h3><p>Serif display, generous whitespace</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="card" data-choice="brutalist" onclick="toggleSelect(this)">
    <div class="card-image"><!-- mini mockup --></div>
    <div class="card-body"><h3>Brutalist</h3><p>Mono type, hard borders, high contrast</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Never reuse filenames — `direction.html`, then `direction-v2.html`. The newest
wins. (CSS classes available: `options`, `cards`, `mockup`, `split`,
`pros-cons`, `mock-nav`, etc. — see `scripts/preview/frame.html`.) The frame
itself reads `/design/tokens.css`, so the chrome already matches the contract.

### B) Themed hi-fi preview → write a **full document**
For the real artifact obeying `DESIGN.md`, write a complete page (starts with
`<!DOCTYPE`); the server serves it as-is. Pull in the repo tokens so the preview
reflects the actual design contract:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <!-- the enforceable design contract — the server serves this from the repo -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/design/tokens.css">
  <style>
    body { background: var(--color-background); color: var(--color-foreground);
           font-family: var(--font-body), serif; }
    h1,h2,h3 { font-family: var(--font-display), serif; }
    /* build with huashu quality + design-philosophy.md (anti-slop) */
  </style>
</head>
<body><!-- the hi-fi sample --></body>
</html>
```
The preview server exposes the repo's `design/` folder at `/design/`, so
`/design/tokens.css` resolves whenever the server was started with
`--project-dir` and the tokens have been exported. (If you ran without
`--project-dir`, inline the tokens in a `<style>` block instead.) Build the
content to the bar in `references/design-philosophy.md`.

## The loop

1. Write a new HTML file to `screen_dir` (Write tool — never cat/heredoc).
2. Tell the user the URL + a one-line summary of what's on screen, and ask them
   to look and respond in the terminal (click to select if choosing).
3. Next turn: read `$STATE_DIR/events` (JSONL of clicks) and merge with their
   terminal reply. The last `choice` is usually the pick.
4. Iterate (new versioned file) or advance. When leaving the browser, push a
   `waiting.html` ("Continuing in terminal…") so stale content isn't left up.

## When the app can't run standalone (needs a backend / env / integrations)

Rendering needs a page that actually renders. **First, check whether it's already
running** — `scripts/detect_server.sh` probes the common dev ports and prints a
reachable URL (or the user may have told you the URL/port). If something is up,
use that URL and skip starting anything. Only if nothing is running do you decide
how to render.

Many real apps can't be rendered by atelier at all — they need a backend, a
database, API keys, auth, or build-time env you can't provision. **Do not**
silently screenshot a broken/empty/error page and treat it as the design. Be
honest and fall back, in this order:

1. **Render the component in isolation (preferred).** You almost never need the
   real backend to evaluate UI. Mount just the target component in a standalone
   single-file HTML harness (inline React/Babel or the framework via CDN), feed it
   **mock data** from `seed_content.py` (incl. the empty/loading/error/long-text
   states), and preview/screenshot THAT. This is how you review a `<Dashboard>`
   without its API — and it's the honest, useful path.
2. **Have the user run it, then point at the URL.** If atelier can't (or shouldn't)
   stand up the app, ASK the user to run it themselves and paste the **URL** — or to
   just confirm it's already up on a port/URL you can reach (e.g. `localhost:3000`).
   Then aim `screenshot.mjs` / `responsive_check.mjs` / the preview at that URL. Or
   have them drop a **screenshot** and use `import_reference.py --image`. (Suggest
   the exact run command if you can infer it, e.g. `npm run dev`.)
3. **Static, render-free work.** Everything that doesn't need a live page still
   works: the DESIGN.md contract, `lint_design` / `audit_contrast` / `slop_check`
   on the source, component generation, the style guide. Say plainly: "I can't run
   the full app (it needs <backend/env>), so I reviewed the component in isolation
   / worked from source — give me a running URL for a full-page pass."

**Detect it early:** if there's no static build (`dist/`/`out/`/`build/`) and the
app has API routes / server code / a DB / required env, assume it won't render
standalone and go straight to component isolation rather than wrestling a dev
server. atelier's job is the frontend/design — it doesn't stand up your backend.

## Stop

```bash
scripts/preview/stop.sh "$SESSION_DIR"
```
`--project-dir` sessions keep their files for later reference; `/tmp` sessions are
removed on stop.
