# Design Philosophy

atelier's job is to produce work that looks **intentionally designed for its
context** — never the convergent, generic output an LLM reaches for by default.
This file is the aesthetic spine the other capabilities lean on. When a project
has a `DESIGN.md`, that file *parameterizes* these rules; this is the default
when it doesn't.

## 1. Think before you style

Before writing any markup, answer four questions (adapted from huashu's
"junior designer" discipline — answer them, then let the system serve the
answers, not the reverse):

1. **Purpose** — what problem does this solve, for whom?
2. **Tone** — commit to ONE bold aesthetic extreme (brutally minimal,
   maximalist, retro-futuristic, editorial, luxury, playful, industrial, …).
   Intentionality beats intensity: refined minimalism and loud maximalism both
   win; timid middles lose.
3. **Constraints** — framework, brand, performance, accessibility targets.
4. **Differentiation** — the one element nobody will forget.

## 2. Embody the right specialist

"HTML is the tool, not the medium." Don't produce "a web page" — become the
specialist the task needs: a UX designer for a prototype, a motion designer for
an animation, a deck designer for slides, an information architect for a
dashboard. The artifact should read as made by that specialist.

## 3. Anti-AI-slop rules (required)

> NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics: overused fonts (Inter, Roboto,
> Arial, system-ui), clichéd color schemes (especially purple gradients on
> white), predictable layouts, and cookie-cutter component patterns.

- **Typography** — choose beautiful, characterful fonts. Pair a distinctive
  display font with a refined body font. Never default to Inter/Roboto/Arial.
- **Color** — commit to a cohesive palette via CSS variables. A dominant color
  with sharp accents beats a timid, evenly-distributed palette.
- **Layout** — unexpected composition: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow,
  grid-breaking elements, generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds** — atmosphere and depth over flat fills: gradient meshes, noise
  textures, geometric patterns, layered transparency, dramatic shadows, grain.
- **Motion** — high-impact moments over scattered micro-interactions. One
  well-orchestrated load with staggered reveals (`animation-delay`) delights more
  than ten random hovers. Prefer CSS-only for plain HTML; Motion for React.
- **Imagery** — use real images (Wikimedia / Met / Unsplash / generated). Never
  hand-draw faces/scenes/objects as SVG — AI SVG people always look wrong. No
  image? Leave an honest placeholder.

### The 2020–2024 cliché blocklist (avoid unless brand-mandated)
- Rounded card + left colored border accent (Material/Tailwind cliché)
- Purple/indigo gradient hero on white
- Three evenly-sized feature cards with a centered icon each
- Glassmorphism applied with no reason

When the task IS to show anti-design (e.g. a "what is AI slop" demo), isolate the
bad sample in an honest container with a dashed border + "Counter-example — do
not do this" badge, so it serves the narrative without polluting the page.

## 4. Match implementation to vision

Maximalist visions need elaborate code (extensive animation, effects, layered
detail). Minimalist visions need restraint and precision — careful spacing,
type, and subtle detail. Elegance is executing the chosen vision fully.

## 5. When the brief is vague — Design Direction Advisor

Don't freeze or default. Offer **3 differentiated directions** drawn from
distinct design schools (e.g. Swiss/Pentagram information clarity, Field.io
motion poetics, Kenya Hara Eastern minimalism, Sagmeister experimental). State
the assumptions, then generate the three as variants the user can pick from
(see `capabilities/variants.md` + `capabilities/preview.md`).

## 6. How DESIGN.md changes these rules

When `DESIGN.md` exists, it OVERRIDES the defaults above with project-specific
law: the locked palette, the chosen fonts, the spacing/radius scale, the allowed
motion, and an explicit anti-slop blocklist for *this* project. It also carries:

- **Component standards** (§7) — the canonical components to reuse and "use X,
  not Y" rules. Reuse before inventing.
- **Data & chart standards** (§8) — how this project presents data (chart choices,
  tables vs cards, empty/loading/error states).
- **House rules** (§9) — the interaction/pattern law, e.g. "use a modal, never a
  flyout/popover". These are often hand-added by the team to encode a company
  standard; `check_rules.py` enforces the machine-checkable ones.

Read all of it, obey it, and only deviate when the user explicitly asks. On a
large/standardized repo these sections are extensive; on a small one they're
light or empty — respect whatever the contract says.
