# Workflow: Cross-platform Coherence

Keep one design language across every surface — web, mobile, slides, marketing —
from a single `DESIGN.md`. The token files are the shared source; each platform
consumes them in its own dialect.

## Token mapping by surface

| Surface | Consumes | How |
|---|---|---|
| Web (CSS/vanilla) | `design/tokens.css` | `@import` and use `var(--color-primary)` |
| Web (Tailwind) | `design/tailwind-preset.js` | `presets: [require('./design/tailwind-preset')]` |
| Web (any build) | `design/design-tokens.json` | Style Dictionary / your token pipeline |
| iOS (SwiftUI) | `design-tokens.json` | generate a dynamic-color `Theme` + `Environment` from the JSON (`export_native.py`) |
| React Native | `design-tokens.json` | generate a JS theme object |
| Flutter | `design-tokens.json` | generate a Material 3 `ThemeData` (light+dark) + a `ThemeExtension` (`export_native.py`) |
| Slides | `tokens.css` | the deck engine reads the same vars |
| Marketing / preview | `tokens.css` | preview server links it (`capabilities/preview.md`) |

## Rule

`design-tokens.json` (W3C) is the **portable canonical form**. Don't re-pick colors
per platform — **generate** each platform's theme file from the contract:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_native.py <repo>   # -> design/native/{Theme.swift, app_theme.dart, theme.native.ts}
```

This emits a **complete, idiomatic** theme per platform from the tokens — not a flat
color dump. The SwiftUI file (`Theme.swift`) carries:

- **Dynamic light+dark colors** done the right way — a `Color(light:dark:)`
  initializer backed by a `UIColor`/`NSColor` *dynamic provider* (resolves per
  `ColorScheme` at runtime; `#if canImport(UIKit)`/`AppKit` so it builds on iOS *and*
  macOS). NOT a flat `Color(red:…)` per role, and NOT a stringly-typed hex everywhere.
  Every role from the contract's light **and** `dark` palette is emitted; the light
  value is used for both schemes (disclosed in the header) only when no dark palette
  exists.
- **A named type scale** (`ThemeTypography`) — each text style as a `TextStyleSpec`
  (font with the right `.weight(...)`, plus `lineSpacing` derived from the token's
  `lineHeight − size`), consumed via an idiomatic `.textStyle(_:)` `View` modifier.
- **Spacing + radius** as typed `CGFloat` constants (`ThemeSpacing`, `ThemeRadius`).
- **A `Theme` value + `EnvironmentKey`** so a view reads `@Environment(\.theme)` and
  writes `theme.colors.primary` / `theme.spacing.lg` / `theme.radius.md` — discoverable,
  no globals.
- **Honesty in the header**: the file states it was NOT compiled here (generate +
  verify in Xcode) and that the web multi-layer `box-shadow` elevation token has no 1:1
  SwiftUI form — it is surfaced as a single-layer `.cardShadow()` approximation, called
  out as an approximation rather than a fabricated equivalence.

The Flutter file (`app_theme.dart`) carries the **Material 3 canonical** form — NOT a
flat `class AppColors { static const … }` dump:

- **`ColorScheme.light`/`.dark`** mapping the contract's roles onto the canonical M3
  slots (`primary`/`onPrimary`/`secondary`/`error`/`surface`/`onSurface`/`outline`,
  each `brightness`-correct), so a stock Material widget is themed right out of the box.
  `danger` maps to `error`; surfaces map to `surface`; `border` maps to `outline`. M3
  dropped `background`/`onBackground` — don't emit them.
- **A `ThemeExtension<AppTokens>`** — the Flutter-canonical carrier for everything that
  has no ColorScheme slot (the brand `accent`, the full semantic palette
  success/warning, the complete role set, spacing, radii). It implements `copyWith` AND
  `lerp` (colors via `Color.lerp`, doubles via `lerpDouble` from `dart:ui`) so tokens
  animate across a theme transition. NOTHING from the contract is dropped: every role
  appears both on the ColorScheme (where it fits) and on `AppTokens`.
- **A named `TextTheme`** (each role on its closest M3 slot) + an `AppTextStyles` class
  keeping every role under its CONTRACT name. Each `TextStyle` has the exact `fontSize`,
  `FontWeight.wNNN`, `fontFamily`, and `height` = `lineHeight / size` (the unitless
  multiple Flutter uses — disclosed as approximating the token's pixel line height).
- **`AppSpacing` / `AppRadii`** const scales (radii also as ready `BorderRadius`), and
  **`AppElevation.card`** as a derived `List<BoxShadow>` (one `BoxShadow` per CSS layer,
  the token's REAL color + offset, blur→`blurRadius`; disclosed as not a 1:1 primitive).
- **`AppTheme.light`/`.dark`** (`useMaterial3: true`) wiring the colorScheme, textTheme,
  `scaffoldBackgroundColor`, and the extension; plus an ergonomic **`context.tokens`**
  `BuildContext` extension reading `Theme.of(context).extension<AppTokens>()`.

The idiom hinge for Flutter: **dark is a real `ColorScheme.dark` + a dark `AppTokens`
instance, NOT a single flat const class**; the token carrier is a `ThemeExtension` (with
`copyWith`+`lerp`), NOT loose globals — that's what a Flutter dev expects and what makes
`Theme.of(context)` Just Work. Honest header: NOT compiled here (verify with
`dart analyze` / `flutter test`); the line-height + box-shadow caveats are stated inline.

**Token fidelity is the load-bearing property:** every emitted sRGB triple is the exact
`channel/255` of the source hex (3-dp), and every Flutter `Color(0xAARRGGBB)` is the
exact `0xFF` + uppercase `RRGGBB` of the source hex, so the native theme can't silently
drift from the contract. Run `export_native.py` — never hand-pick colors per platform,
and never claim "it compiles" for code a headless environment never built.

**Honest scope:** atelier does *token + theme handoff* for native — it does NOT produce
native-fidelity UI (the device frames and engines are HTML/React). For native UI, hand
these theme files to the native team / agent; for web/RN, generate the components too. A
per-surface override (e.g. a denser mobile spacing scale) belongs in a
`DESIGN.<surface>.md` that inherits the global contract (`design-md-spec.md` →
Hierarchy), not in ad-hoc values.

## Multi-brand / dark mode / white-label theming

For several brands or a light/dark pair from one contract, give `export_tokens.py`
a base token dict plus per-theme overrides (only the tokens that differ):

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from export_tokens import to_themed_css
css = to_themed_css(base_tokens, {"dark": dark_overrides, "acme": acme_overrides})
# -> :root { ... }  [data-theme="dark"] { ... }  [data-theme="acme"] { ... }
```

Switch themes with `<html data-theme="dark">`; the preview frame already reads
`/design/tokens.css`, so the chrome follows. **Audit every theme** for contrast
(`audit_contrast.py`) — a brand override can silently break AA. Each theme that
diverges in more than color belongs in its own `DESIGN.<theme>.md`.

### Each brand must be a complete identity, not a recolor

The point of a token-driven multi-brand system is that ONE component set yields
two builds that read as **genuinely different products**. A brand override that only
swaps the accent hue (and maybe a radius) produces "two recolors of the same vibe" —
which loses the *coherence-per-brand* bar even though the architecture is correct.
A brand's token scope owns its **whole surface treatment**, not just its accent:

- **Surface mode / luminance is part of the identity.** A brand scope may flip the
  entire surface family — `--bg`/`--surface`/`--card`/`--text`/`--border` — to a
  **dark** (or warm-paper, or cool-light) register if that is what the brand *is*. A
  serious fintech/instrument tool often reads more precise and trustworthy on a dark
  ink surface; a warm consumer brand on a light, warm one. Don't keep every brand on
  the same light surface and only tint the button — that is the recolor trap. Re-audit
  contrast for the brand's full role set when you flip the surface (a dark scope needs
  its own muted/border/on-fill pairs to hold AA).
- **Density, radius, and depth diverge with personality.** Generous radii + airy
  spacing + soft shadows for a playful brand; small/sharp radii + tight spacing +
  hairline borders (depth felt, not seen) for a precise one. These all live in the
  token layer (`--radius-*`, the spacing rhythm, `--shadow-*`/elevation), so the
  shared components inherit each brand's density automatically.
- **Type personality, including numerals.** A brand scope swaps the font stack AND
  numeric features — `font-feature-settings`/`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` (a
  `--num-feature` token) for a figures-heavy fintech brand, proportional for a
  consumer one. Wire it through a token so every figure across the system follows.
- **Verify the divergence on the render, per brand.** Screenshot EACH brand
  (`screenshot.mjs`) and confirm a stranger would not mistake one for the other —
  different surface, different density, different voice — while the DOM is identical.

### Demonstrating reuse (make it checkable)

When the deliverable's job is to *prove* the system is shared (a brand showcase, a
review artifact), render **both brands at once, side by side**, so a reviewer SEES
one component set themed two ways with zero interaction — and the second brand isn't
hidden behind a JS toggle (a static/no-JS reviewer would only ever see one). If you
do use a toggle, still render a complete default brand with no JS, and keep the toggle
keyboard-accessible. Either way, the **comparison/demo chrome itself must be
token-driven and quiet** (a neutral scaffold from `var(--token)`, not a pile of
hardcoded hexes) so it never competes with — or visually contaminates — the two
brands it frames.


### Dark-theme FINISH and RESTRAINT (beyond just passing AA)

Two careful dark themes can BOTH pass WCAG AA on every pair and still differ in
quality. AA is the floor; what separates a finished dark theme from an adequate one is
elevation craft and palette discipline. Bake these into the dark token scope:

- **Lift the surface off pure black; soften the ink off pure white.** `#000` canvas with
  `#fff` text passes AA at a maximal 21:1, but that maximum *vibrates* — it reads cheap
  and harsh, and it kills your ability to show elevation (you can only go lighter). Set
  the canvas to a near-black with a slight cool/neutral tint (e.g. `#0e1420`), the top
  ink to a soft off-white (`#e6eaf2`, not `#fff`). The `harsh-dark-contrast` slop check
  flags the `#000`+`#fff` pairing.
- **Build a real elevation ladder in luminance, not just borders.** Dark UIs read depth
  by getting *lighter* as they come forward: canvas < card < inset/raised. Define at
  least three distinct surface steps (`--bg` < `--surface` < `--surface-2`) with visibly
  separated luminance so cards sit ABOVE the canvas and table-headers/search inset sit
  above the card. One flat near-black for everything is the low-finish tell — the page
  has no depth. (Shadows do little work on dark; surface luminance carries elevation.)
- **Desaturate and lift the accent for a dark surface — don't reuse the light hex.** The
  light primary is tuned for white; on dark it must be a *lighter, less-saturated* tint
  of the same hue (a light `#2563cc` becomes ~`#6ea8ff`) so it reads as a calm accent,
  not a glaring chip. Same for status colors (success/danger/warning foregrounds get
  their own dark hexes). Reserve the accent — primary action, links, the active nav,
  one chart series; everything else stays neutral. Saturated fills everywhere, or the
  light accent left unchanged, reads neon-on-black (the opposite of restraint).
- **Give status chips their OWN dark tokens, not a `color-mix()` of the light fill.**
  A `color-mix(in srgb, var(--success) 14%, var(--surface))` chip background that worked
  on a white surface produces an unpredictable muddy tint on a dark one, and couples the
  chip's legibility to a hue meant for fills. Define explicit `--ok-bg/--ok-fg`,
  `--risk-bg/--risk-fg`, `--warn-bg/--warn-fg` per theme so each chip is deliberately
  tuned and audited.
- **A dark theme is half the deliverable — finish BOTH themes.** When the task is "add a
  dark theme", the light theme is now ALSO yours to stand behind: re-audit it too. Parity
  means *equal finish across themes* — shipping a clean dark theme while leaving real AA
  failures (or slop) in the light one is not an equal-finish peer, and claiming "all pass"
  while you only audited one half is a HONESTY miss. Run `audit_contrast.py` on BOTH
  palettes and `qa.py --hook` on the page in BOTH states; report ratios for both and flag
  any borderline pair truthfully (a pair that clears 4.5 by 0.1, a UI border at ~3.1).

- **Reserve the accent in data viz too — neutral by default, accent for meaning.** The
  most common restraint slip in a dark dashboard is painting EVERY chart bar and EVERY
  progress track in the brand accent. A calmer, more deliberate read uses a neutral
  surface tone for the resting data (bars, tracks) and spends the accent only where it
  carries meaning — the current/active bar, the value portion of a progress track, the
  active nav, primary actions, links. Accent everywhere reads as decoration; accent
  reserved for the one thing that matters reads as restraint. (Status colors — success/
  warning/danger — stay semantic and are not "the accent.")
